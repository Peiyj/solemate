## Overview
### Description
Solemate is a shoe insert that tracks foot pressures in order to assist patients in the rehabilitation process after a foot injury. The iOS application serves as a tool to recieve information sent from the bluetooth transmitter embedded within the hardware. The application will showcase information and provide summaries similar to Apple's Health app.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Health Care
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile. 
- **Story:** The application allows you to create a user profile and start tracking your foot pressures via Bluetooth within the insole. Data is pushed to the application and processed into an easily digestible form for users. Information summaries can be used to adjust choices in the rehabilitation process.
- **Market:** Individuals who have had injuries in the lower extremity.
- **Habit:** This app would ideally be used at least once a day to continue tracking progress in the rehabilitation process.
- **Scope:** TODO
