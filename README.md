## Overview
### Description
Solemate is a shoe insert that tracks foot pressures in order to assist patients in the rehabilitation process after a foot injury. The iOS application serves as a tool to recieve information sent from the bluetooth transmitter embedded within the hardware. The application will showcase information and provide summaries similar to Apple's Health app.

### App Evaluation

Data is pushed to the application and processed into an easily digestible form for users. Information summaries can be used to adjust choices in the rehabilitation process.
- **Market:** Individuals who have had injuries in the lower extremity.
- **Habit:** This app would ideally be used at least once a day to continue tracking progress in the rehabilitation process.
- **Scope:** TODO
